# Interfaces

We implement the interfaces as described in https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Document_Object_Model.

We use only what each interfaces adds and nothing anythin it inherits.

If anything is missing, or you'd like to see something sooner rather than later, let us know. We're happy to implement a feature if we're making it and you need it anyway.

Anything marked unsafe inherits or negative side effects that the original API represents. If it's safe, that means we do a few checks to ensure it works as any sane person believes.
