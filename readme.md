# dom-ts

All applicable implementations of browser API's to be consumed by the fp-ts ecosystem.

## Extensibility

There is currently no way to infer what the event map is of an element via Typescript.
Our solution was to manually go through each element and get the element's `tagName`, `Element` and `EventMap`.
